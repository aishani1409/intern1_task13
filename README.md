1. Installed MySQL on my system and created a basic database with at least one table.
2. Added the JDBC driver to my project and established a connection between my Java application and the MySQL database.
3. Inserted data into the table using a PreparedStatement.
4. Fetched and displayed the stored data using a ResultSet.
5. Performed update and delete operations on the existing records.
6. Used prepared statements to protect my application from SQL injection attacks.
7. Handled any database-related errors properly using exception handling.
8. Made sure to close all database resources (Connection, Statement, ResultSet) after use to avoid memory leaks.
